With a background in Social-Economic Statistics, I have spent the past four years as a research assistant and data analyst at a prominent research center focusing on substance abuse and HIV/AIDS.\r\nThroughout my professional journey, I have witnessed the power of data in shaping our understanding of complex health issues. Inspired by this realization, I have embarked on a captivating expedition into the world of health data visualization.\r\nMy aim is to bring together my expertise in statistics and my passion for visual storytelling to create compelling and impactful data visualizations. By translating intricate health data into visually engaging graphics, charts, and interactive dashboards, I strive to unlock insights, facilitate understanding, and advocate for evidence-based decision-making.\r\nWelcome aboard, and let’s embark on this transformative journey together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
